# Simple Password Manager
It's been a very long time since I've done any GUI programming in C++ so this is a very barebones password manager to rebuild some of those skills. Obviouslly I wouldn't use this software seriously as it's more demonstrative.

This is built with [C++ Builder Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder/starter).
